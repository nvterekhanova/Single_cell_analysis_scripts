# Here are scripts that are often used to run DEGs/DAPs analysis using FindMarkers (Seurat project).

  * These scripts were used in BRCA and in PanCan snATAC projects.

  * Also, here included version using presto for DEGs/DAPs analysis (https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/weighted_nearest_neighbor_analysis.html).


1. ```ATAC`` -- contains scripts for diff. accessible chromatin regions (DACRs).

2. ```RNA``` -- contains scripts for diff. expressed genes (DEGs).

3. ```additional/DEGs_DACRs_with_presto``` -- alternative fast way to calculate DEGs/DACRs (wasn't used in the paper).
